# linux-assigment
have written all the basic commands in linux with its description, syntax, why and when we use it and its implementation. In this pdf file i have documented more than 20 commands in detail along with the snapshots of the implementation part. Along with these commands, I have added three different scripts that are:-

1)backup a directory:- This script copies a specified directory to a backup folder with a timestamp. I have added the code of the script  you can refer the source code and its output is also given in the same
CPU/memory monitoring:- This script logs the CPU and memory usage to a file at regular intervals. I have added the code of the script , you can refer the source code and its output given in the doc attached.
Automated Download Task:- This script downloads a file from the internet using "wget" or "curl" commands and store it in a predefined directory. I have added the code of the script , you can refer the source code and its output given in the doc. For a very detailed report and documentation, you can refer the files "2501010216(priyanshi)ass" docx file. In these files you can see that,i have documented my work in detail along with the snapshots of the implementation part as an evidence. You will also find the same scripts in these files along with the reflection that I have gained.
Thank you !
